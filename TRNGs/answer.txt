Lab Note-Book Answers

Here are the conceptual answers for your lab note-book, based on the expected outcomes of the experiment:

1. Which bitstream appears more random and why?

Expected Answer: The Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) bitstream will likely appear more random based only on the Entropy and Chi-Square tests.

Reasoning:

    A well-implemented PRNG (like std::mt19937) is designed to have an almost perfect uniform distribution (equal 0s and 1s) and high entropy over short sequences, because its output is deterministic and engineered to pass these basic statistical tests perfectly.

    The TRNG, even after post-processing, is based on a noisy physical source. While the Von Neumann extractor removes first-order bias (unequal probability of 0 and 1), the resulting stream might still contain subtle non-random patterns or correlations (higher-order bias) that a more advanced test (like the NIST Statistical Test Suite) would catch. However, the basic Entropy and Chi-Square tests primarily look for uniformity, which the PRNG is mathematically guaranteed to have better.

    Conclusion: For these basic tests, the PRNG's output is statistically more uniform and thus "more random," but it is still predictable (which is the critical difference).

2. Did the TRNG pass both the statistical tests?

Expected Answer:

    The TRNG should pass the Chi-Square test (meaning the χ2 value is low enough) and have an Entropy value close to 1 if the Von Neumann extractor effectively removed the initial bias and the raw source was sufficiently noisy.

    A "Pass" in this context means the χ2 value is small enough not to reject the null hypothesis that the bits come from a fair coin flip (P0​=P1​=0.5).

    The quality of the raw source (system timing jitter) is highly variable, so the success of the TRNG depends heavily on the specific hardware/OS environment.

3. How does the Von Neumann extractor improve randomness?

The Von Neumann extractor is specifically designed to eliminate bias (first-order statistical non-uniformity), meaning it makes the probability of a '0' equal to the probability of a '1' (P0​≈P1​≈0.5).

    Mechanism: It operates on pairs of bits from a biased source.

        P(01): probability of the sequence 01

        P(10): probability of the sequence 10

        If the input bits are independent, P(01)=P(0)⋅P(1) and P(10)=P(1)⋅P(0).

        Since multiplication is commutative, P(0)⋅P(1)=P(1)⋅P(0).

        By only taking 0 from 01 and 1 from 10, the output bitstream is guaranteed to have P(output 0)=P(01)=P(10)=P(output 1), thus removing the bias, regardless of the initial P(0) and P(1).

4. Why is TRNG important for security even if PRNG outputs look random?

TRNG is critical for security because its output is unpredictable, while a PRNG's output is deterministic.

    Unpredictability (True Randomness): TRNGs rely on chaotic, physical processes (like thermal noise). The output cannot be calculated or guessed, even if an attacker knows the previous outputs and the generator's design. This is essential for creating truly secret cryptographic keys, salts, and nonces.

    Determinism (Pseudo-Randomness): A PRNG's output is entirely determined by its seed and its algorithm.

        If an attacker can guess or obtain the seed used by a PRNG (often based on time/PID), they can perfectly predict all future "random" numbers generated by that PRNG.

        If an attacker can observe enough of the output, they might be able to reverse-engineer the internal state and predict future outputs (especially for weaker PRNGs).

In security, if a key or nonce is predictable (even if it passes statistical tests), the entire system is vulnerable. TRNGs are used to generate the initial, high-quality seed for a Cryptographically Secure PRNG (CSPRNG), which then efficiently produces the large quantities of statistically random, but still deterministic, bits needed for cryptographic operations.
